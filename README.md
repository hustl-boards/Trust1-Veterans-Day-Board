# 3R Veterans Day Office TV

Static GitHub Pages slideshow for the office TV. Twenty-two silent 15-second clips play in order, each through to the end, then the loop starts over.

The TV opens <https://ross680.github.io/Veterans-Day-Office-Board/>.

It follows the same full-screen board as the [Christmas Board](https://github.com/ross680/Christmas-Office-Board), the [Motivational Board](https://github.com/ross680/Motivational-Board), and the [Halloween Board](https://github.com/ross680/Halloween-Board): one stage, a thin progress bar, hover controls, a screen wake lock, and a reload so a TV left on overnight picks up changes. Clips live in `assets/clips/`.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

The page is a normal static site. It does not call the GitHub API.

1. Push this folder to `main`.
2. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Branch: **main**. Folder: **/** (root).
5. Open <https://ross680.github.io/Veterans-Day-Office-Board/> on the TV browser.

Pages can take a minute after the push. The TV may keep the previous `index.html` for about 10 minutes. The board also reloads itself every 4 hours, after the current clip finishes, so a new playlist shows up on its own.

`.nojekyll` is in the repo so Pages serves the files as they are.

## Controls

Right arrow or Space: next · Left arrow: previous · P: pause · M: sound on/off · F: fullscreen

Clips start muted so Chrome and TV browsers allow autoplay. M, or the sound button, turns sound on. The clips in this set are silent.

Hover the picture to see the controls and the clip count (`3 / 22`). The days-until-Veterans-Day chip stays in the corner. It counts down to Wednesday, November 11, 2026, in America/New_York, and reads `15 DAYS UNTIL VETERANS DAY` on October 27. On November 11 it reads `HAPPY VETERANS DAY — THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE`, and it keeps that thank-you after the day has passed. The day before, it reads `1 DAY UNTIL VETERANS DAY`.

## URL options

- `?reload=4` reloads every 4 hours (the default), after the current clip ends. `?reload=0` turns that off. The board checks once a minute, because some TV browsers drop one long timer.
- `?maxclip=60` is a hard cap per video, in seconds (default 60). A normal clip ends itself first.
- `?stall=20` skips a clip with no playback progress for 20 seconds.
- `?watchdog=90` if the reel makes no progress for 90 seconds, the page reloads once. If it just reloaded and is still stuck, it waits a minute instead of reboot-looping.
- `?shuffle=1` randomizes the order when the page loads.
- `?slide=3` starts on that clip (1 is the first).
- `?date=2026-11-11` previews the countdown for that calendar day.
- `?fresh=1` loads a new page for every clip. Last resort for a TV that still leaks memory.
- `?debug=1` shows the clip name, uptime, page loads, and the last problem.

A clip that errors, or never produces a picture, is skipped. One bad file does not stop the board.

## Add or remove a clip

`clips.js` is the only playlist. The board plays that list from top to bottom. It does not scan the folder.

1. Put a 16:9 file in `assets/clips/` (MP4, WebM, or MOV). 1920×1080 is what the current clips are. Number the name (`vd21-your-title.mp4`) so the order stays obvious.
2. Add a line to `window.CLIPS` where that clip should play. To take a clip off the board, delete that line. The file can stay in the folder or go with it.
3. Commit and push to `main`.

Renaming a file does not change the order. The list does.

When you replace a file and keep the same name, change the `?v=` text on that line (any new string). That is the cache buster, same idea as the Halloween board. Leave `?v=` alone when the bytes did not change, or the TV downloads the clip again for no reason.

`app.js` is linked with `?v=20261027a` and `styles.css` with `?v=20261027b`. Bump that text in `index.html` when you change those files so the TV does not keep an old copy. You do not need to touch it when you only edit `clips.js`.

## Keeping the picture moving

One `<video>` element is reused. Each clip is detached (`pause`, clear `src`, `load()`) before the next one so the TV can free the decoder.

After the scheduled reload the page resumes on the next clip, rather than jumping back to the first one.

## Encoding

Every shipped clip is the same shape: 1920×1080, 24 fps, 15.0 seconds, H.264 High profile level 4.1, faststart, plus a silent AAC track. The set is about 111 MB. Desktop Chrome plays that.

A lot of TVs only hardware-decode Baseline or Main. High profile with B-frames can stay black, which is what the Halloween board ran into. If this TV does that, re-encode on a computer, put the new file in place of the old one, change `?v=`, and push:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i "INPUT.mp4" \
  -c:v libx264 -profile:v main -level:v 4.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -r 24 -b:v 1800k -maxrate 2200k -bufsize 3600k -bf 0 \
  -an \
  -movflags +faststart \
  "OUTPUT.mp4"
```

If the picture is still black, use `-profile:v baseline -level:v 4.0 -bf 0` in place of the Main profile line.
